We are interested in discovering the mechanisms that generate biodiversity of fishes, specifically the genesis of genomic, developmental and morphological diversity as well as their evolutionary interconnections. To this end, we study: 1) phylogenies inferred from DNA sequence data to investigate speciation, historical biogeography, and the timing of lineage diversification, 2) morphological differentiation and its genetic basis within a phylogenetic framework, 3) genomic divergence among populations and species, and 4) the evolution of genomes and important functional genes. We currently use molecular and bioinformatic approaches, to ask how many and what kind of genetic changes accompany morphological differentiation among populations and species.

Phylogeny
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml).

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
