We are interested in discovering the mechanisms that generate biodiversity of fishes, specifically the genesis of genomic, developmental and morphological diversity as well as their evolutionary interconnections. To this end, we study: 1) phylogenies inferred from DNA sequence data to investigate speciation, historical biogeography, and the timing of lineage diversification, 2) morphological differentiation and its genetic basis within a phylogenetic framework, 3) genomic divergence among populations and species, and 4) the evolution of genomes and important functional genes. We currently use molecular and bioinformatic approaches, to ask how many and what kind of genetic changes accompany morphological differentiation among populations and species.

Phylogenetic tree of fishes
------
We construct evolutionary trees to understand the relationships among living vertebrates, with a special focus on the diverse clade of ray-finned fishes, Actinopterygii. By analyzing DNA sequence data, we aim to trace the lineage diversification and historical biogeography of these species, uncovering the deep evolutionary connections that unite them.

Genetic basis of morphological adaptation
------
We explore the genetic foundations that enable organisms to adapt to their environments, focusing on how genetic variation contributes to phenotypic diversity. By identifying key genes and regulatory pathways, we aim to understand the molecular basis of adaptation and its evolutionary significance.

Genomics of population divergence
------
Our research investigates how species rapidly adapt to changing environments at the genomic level, examining the genetic architecture and evolutionary dynamics behind swift phenotypic shifts. We employ cutting-edge genomic tools to identify the signatures of rapid adaptation in natural populations.

Evolution of genes and genomes
------
We study the evolutionary processes that shape the structure, function, and diversity of genes and genomes across species. By comparing genomes, we aim to uncover the patterns and mechanisms driving genomic innovation and evolutionary change over time.
